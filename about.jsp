				   	 				<p>We use the CEO’s office for private meetings as the rest of the office is open plan.
				   	 				 He also never signs out of his email.
				   	 				  I was meeting a client when I glanced at the screen and noticed the top email was notes on a meeting on my future in the business.
				   	 				   I finished my meeting and read the notes. 
				   	 				   The gist was that I was wrong for the position but they were not certain what the position should be. 
				   	 				   Several of the options discussed were about making me redundant with one month’s notice.
				   	 				    however the decision made was to set me clearer goals and have an honest conversation with me. 
				   	 				    I’ve since been issued with share options and no conversation has taken place.</p>

For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers.
